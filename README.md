### 📜 Description
This project contains a specialized algorithm designed to simulate and regulate **Dark Energy** levels within a digital environment. It serves as a foundational component of **Project Omega**, ensuring stability by preventing negative energy collapse.

### 🧠 Theoretical Framework: Why Dark Matter?
In astrophysics, **Dark Matter** constitutes approximately 85% of the matter in the universe. It is invisible, yet it holds galaxies together. Without it, the cosmic structure would fly apart.

Similarly, within the **Project Omega Architecture**, this algorithm acts as the **'Digital Gravity'**. Standard coding manages visible data ("Light Matter"), but this protocol manages the unseen variables—memory voids, entropy, and null-value collapses.

**This system ensures that the simulation remains stable even under infinite load, acting as a bio-digital stabilizing agent for the next generation of AI.**

### 🚀 Key Features
* **Energy Regulation:** Simulates the injection and reduction of cosmic energy.
* **Safety Protocols:** Ensures energy levels never drop below absolute zero.
* **State Monitoring:** Provides real-time tracking of current energy density.

### 📂 Source Code
The core logic is available in the script file. Please check the repository files to view the implementation.
